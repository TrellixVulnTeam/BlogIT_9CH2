you need a few things for this project to be able to work correctly,
this is was my first time learning and using the rest_framework for django so please
bear with me.

the backend of this project is hosted on heroku, I rather not share that link but it works.
The front-end is made using react and redux, I AM A BEGINNER AT REACT, I love JavaScript and I needed to learn a
framework so between school and everything I've been trying to learn react.

Lots more left to learn and I will continue to by making stuff hopefully.
ok so the part that messed me up is cross-origins resource sharing
without the cors plug in on google chrome installed and enabled this project link wont work as expected

the link is

https://blogit-7b9d0.firebaseapp.com

the react front-end is hosted on firebase, I wanted to host it on s3 as well but i'm  going to save that for another
project I am working on.

This is how the sign up page looks like

This is how the sign in page looks like

this is how it looks when a logged in user views the home page, they see their global feed which list all the posts that occured since last login

and they see their own feed, which contains post by people they follow

they can click on other users, follow them, like their posts, and comment on them.


so this is how it looks when a logged in user wants to create a blog post
