you need a few things for this project to be able to work correctly,
this is was my first time learning and using the rest_framework for django so please
bear with me.

the backend of this project is hosted on heroku, I rather not share that link but it works.
The front-end is made using react and redux, I AM A BEGINNER AT REACT, I love JavaScript and I needed to learn a
framework so between school and everything I've been trying to learn react.

Lots more left to learn and I will continue to by making stuff hopefully.
ok so the part that messed me up is cross-origins resource sharing
without the cors plug in on google chrome installed and enabled this project link wont work as expected

the link is

https://blogit-7b9d0.firebaseapp.com

the react front-end is hosted on firebase, I wanted to host it on s3 as well but i'm  going to save that for another
project I am working on.
